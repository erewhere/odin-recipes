    <h3>How to Make Chicken Pot Pie (Steps):</h3>

        <li>Butter time:</li>
        <p>While chicken is cooking, melt butter in another saucepan over medium heat. Add onion and cook until soft and translucent, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir in flour, salt, pepper, and celery seed.</p>

        <li>Cover:</li>
        <p>Cover with top crust, seal the edges, and cut away any excess dough. Make several small slits in the top crust to allow steam to escape.</p>
