# odin-recipes
Here's a funky introduction to how nice I am. Tell your mother, tell your friends, send a telegram.

The current project is Odin Recipes. I do not yet fully know what the project is about, however as per the courseload and current stage of the process - I am meant to practice all of the HTML knowledge that I have acquired.

In this project I am going to build a recipe website.

The site will consist of a main index page and that page will have links to a few recipes. It won't look very pretty (HAHAHHAHA) but by the time I'm finished I will have built some of my HTML 'chops'.

Later, I will revisit this page ans style it up with some CSS (cascading style sheets).

CIAO for now.
